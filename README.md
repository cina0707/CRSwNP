This repository contains the full analytical workflow, intermediate files, and clinical metadata for our 16S rRNA gene sequencing project.
- Each FigX/ folder holds the exact intermediate files (e.g., OTU tables, distance matrices, taxonomic summaries) required to reproduce the corresponding plot.
- sample_data/ contains de-identified clinical information for every sample.
- All folders are at the same hierarchical level to facilitate scripted access.
